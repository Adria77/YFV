# YFV
Yellow fever virus (YFV) is caused by single stranded positive RNA virus called Flavivirus, which cause severe diseases such as Yellow fever or Dengue. The replicative machinery used by the virus consists in several enzymes including two methyltransferases, located in the N-terminal domain of the NS5 non-structural protein. YFV methyltransferases are involved in the last steps of the mRNA capping process, in which a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine is transferred onto the N7 position of the cap guanine, reaction catalyzed by a guanine-N7 methyltransferase, and the ribose 2’O position of the first nucleotide after the cap guanine, which is carried out by a nucleoside-2’O methyltransferase. The RNA capping process is a crucial step for the mRNA processing, translation and stability, making these enzymes attractive targets for the design of antiviral drugs. In the present study, starting for the crystal structure of Yellow fever virus methyltransferase, we used an in silico docking procedure that led the identification of commercial compounds that would display high affinity for the methyltransferase active sites. Also, high-potency inhibitor candidates have been docked to other Flavivirus methyltransferases like Zika virus and to human methyltransferases (CMTR1 and CMTR2).
